        <h1>A person who can make ordinary to Extraordinary!!!</h1>

        <p>
            Ahemm… okay… so where do I even begin? 👀 Okay let's start with the time I met with you... First day, playing UNO with you... Never thaught that that moment will be the start or something Lovely... From then on, the ordinary felt a little too ordinary without you. Yk that feeling when something small makes your day better? Yeah… for me, that's <span class="highlight">you!!!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Like that song plays in my head every morning:
            <span style="display: block; margin-top: 10px; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.1em;">"Tum Se Hi Din Shuru Hota Hai…" 🎶</span> and ends with <span class="glowing-purple">"Raataan Lambiyan"</span>...
        </p>

        <div class="section-break"></div>

        <h2>🥺 You’re just the Definition of Beautiful…</h2>
        <p>
            People say beauty is what we see, but I think I found beauty that I can feel... <span class="glowing-text">in YOU</span> <span class="beating-heart">💗</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Your cuteness? <span class="highlight">Dangerous. 🌚</span>
            But your heart? That’s what makes you unforgettable...
            From your little shy smiles… to the “ahemmm~~” moments 🌚✨, to how you notice small things about me… It’s like you’re made of all the things that matter to me...
        </p>
        <p>
            Every time you look at me, even for a second, it’s like:
            <span style="display: block; margin-top: 10px; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.1em;">"Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms</span>
            <span style="display: block; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.1em;">Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song</span>
            <span style="display: block; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.1em;">When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath</span>
            <span style="display: block; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.1em;">But you heard it, "Darling, you look perfect tonight"" 🎶<span class="beating-heart">💞</span></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Because somehow, loving you started feeling <span class="glowing-purple">natural…</span>
        </p>

        <div class="section-break"></div>

        <h2>☀️ You’re My Calm… And you are My Chaos tooo</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes I wonder how just hearing from you turns my worst days into ones I am going to remember. 🥹 Every conversation with you feels like <span class="highlight">magic trapped in seconds…</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            I still don’t know how you became "this", so maybe that’s why I keep thinking:
            <span style="display: block; margin-top: 10px; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.1em;">"Tera Ban Jaunga…" 🎵</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Because in my mind, I already belong to you… quietly, hopelessly, willingly.
        </p>

        <div class="section-break"></div>

        <h2>🌙 So, Here's My Silly Little Wish…</h2>
        <p>
            I wish to walk beside you… not just today, not just tomorrow… but for a <span class="glowing-text">lifetime... 🌸</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            To keep seeing that smile…
            To keep hearing those tiny giggles…
            To keep being your reason to blush just once more.
        </p>
        <p>
            You’re not just someone I admire.
            You’re not just someone I like.
            You're someone I could <span class="highlight">fall for completely…</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe I already have.
        </p>

        <div class="section-break"></div>

        <h2><span class="beating-heart">💖</span> In Short… You’re My Favourite Song.</h2>
        <p>
            And if I had to sum this up like the perfect lyrics… it’d be:
            <span style="display: block; margin-top: 10px; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.1em;">"When I look into your eyes, it’s like watching the night sky… or a beautiful sunrise…" ✨</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Because that’s what you are to me.
            My sunrise after endless nights.
        </p>

        <h2>🔐 So… Shall We Continue? 😳</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Ahemmmm~ 🌚
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Click that button and take my hand...
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Because someone’s waiting on the other side…
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            Someone who’s dreaming of calling you his forever.
        </p>
