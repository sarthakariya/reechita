        <h1>My Beautiful Reechita... ✨</h1>
        <p> 👀 Okay let's start with the time I met with you... First day, playing UNO with you... Never thaught that that moment will be the start or something Lovely... From then on, the ordinary felt a little too ordinary without you. </p>
        <p> Yk that feeling when something small makes your day better? </p>
        <p> Yeah… for me, that's <span class="highlight">you!!!</span> </p>

        <p> Like that song plays in my head every morning: <span style="display: block; margin-top: 10px; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.1em;">"Tum Se Hi Din Shuru Hota Hai…" 🎶</span> and ends with <span class="glowing-purple">"Raataan Lambiyan"</span>... </p>

        <div class="section-break"></div>

        <h2>🥺 You’re just the Definition of Beautiful…</h2>
        <p> People say beauty is what we see, but I think I found beauty that I can feel... <span class="glowing-text">in YOU</span> 💗 </p>
        <p> Your cuteness? <span class="highlight">Dangerous. 🌚</span> But your heart? That’s what makes you unforgettable... From your little shy smiles… to the “ahemmm~~” moments 🌚✨, to how you notice small things about me… It’s like you’re made of all the things that matter to me... </p>
        <p> Every time you look at me, even for a second, it’s like: <span style="display: block; margin-top: 10px; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.1em;">"Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms</span> <span style="display: block; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.1em;">Barefoot on the...</span> </p>

        <div class="section-break"></div>

        <h2>🌙 So, Here's My Silly Little Wish…</h2>
        <p> I wish to walk beside you… not just today, not just tomorrow… but for a <span class="glowing-text">lifetime... 🌸</span> </p>
        <p> To keep seeing that smile… To keep hearing those tiny giggles… To keep being your reason to blush just once more. </p>
        <p> You’re not just someone I admire. You’re not just someone I like. You're someone I could <span class="highlight">fall for completely…</span> </p>
        <p> Maybe I already have. </p>

        <div class="section-break"></div>

        <h2>💖 In Short… You’re My Favourite Song.</h2>
        <p> And if I had to sum this up like the perfect lyrics… it’d be: <span style="display: block; margin-top: 10px; font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: 1.1em;">"When I look into your eyes, it’s like watching the night sky… or a beautiful sunrise…" ✨</span> </p>
        <p> Because that’s what you are to me. My sunrise after endless nights. </p>

        <h2>🔐 So… Shall We Continue? 😳</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Ahemmmm~ 🌚 </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Click that button and take my hand... </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Because someone’s waiting on the other side… </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Someone who’s dreaming of calling you his forever. </p>
